# Compute transport across meridional section across North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre 

1. Meridional Flow is calculated at latitude 26N using CDF tools 
2. Flow is divided into the Western Boundary Current (WBD) and the Interior (Int) ocean contribution
4. Flow is further vertically divided in upper and lower layers using 1000-m depth as cropping level

## HR-EC-earth Model Simulations

Hspu: 350-yr Pre-Industrial (PrI) for 1850

Hist: Historical (1850-2014) starts from year ~250 of PrI (should check from which exact model year)

Hist: SSP2-4.5 (2015-2100) continues from historical

Cdio: 1% per year increasing of CO2 experiment: starts from year ~250 of PrI

Cfix: Fixed CO2 at 551.5 ppm starting from year 1917 of 1% CO2 run

Cfx2: Fixed CO2 at 400.9 starting from year 1885 of 1% CO2 run
