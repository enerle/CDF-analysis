# Compute transport across meridional section across North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre 

1. Meridional Flow is calculated at latitude 26N using CDF tools 
2. Flow is divided into the Western Boundary Current (WBD) and the Interior (Int) ocean contribution
4. Flow is further vertically divided into upper and lower layers using 1000-m depth as cropping level
