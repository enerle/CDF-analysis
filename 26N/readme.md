# Compute transport across meridional section 26oN using CDF tools 

Meridional flow is divided into the Western Boundary Current (WBD) and the Interior (Int) ocean contribution

Flow is further vertically divided at 1000-m depth

Data comes from HR-EC-earth model

## Simulations
- Hspu: 350-yr Pre-Industrial (PrI) for 1850
- Hist: Historical (1850-2014) starts from year ~250 of PrI (should check from which exact model year)
- Hist: SSP2-4.5 (2015-2100) continues from historical
- Cdio: 1% per year increasing of CO2 experiment: starts from year ~250 of PrI
- Cfix: Fixed CO2 at 551.5 ppm starting from year 1917 of 1% CO2 run
- Cfx2: Fixed CO2 at 400.9 starting from year 1885 of 1% CO2 run
