- Simulations
    Hspu: 350-yr Pre-Industrial (PrI) for 1850
    Hist: Historical (1850-2014) starts from year ~250 of PrI
    Hist: SSP2-4.5 (2015-2100) continues from historical
    Cdio: 1% per year increasing of CO2 experiment (1pctCO2): starts from year ~250 of PrI
    Cfix: Fixed CO2 at 551.5 ppm starting from year 1917 of 1% CO2 run
    Cfx2: Fixed CO2 at 400.9 starting from year 1885 of 1% CO2 run
- Details:
The two fixed CO2 concentrations experiments (400.9 ppm and 551.5 ppm) were initialized from points corresponding to global temperature anomalies of around 1째C and 2째C in the 1pctCO2 experiment. In the fixed CO2 experiment at 400.9 ppm, Arctic warming reached approximately 3.7째C, similar to conditions during the Last Interglacial period. In the fixed CO2 experiment at 551.5 ppm, the global mean temperature increased by around 2째C. Both fixed CO2 experiments showed a rapid reduction of summer sea ice, with sea ice disappearing by the end of the simulation under the 551.5 ppm CO2 concentration. Both simulations equilibrated at a higher global warming level.
